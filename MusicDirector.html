            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">Characterized by a virtuosic technique and a warm, rich, velvet tone, Brian Bowman’s playing has thrilled audiences for more than half of a century. His superb musicianship and dedication to fine brass playing made him one of the foremost euphonium soloists in the world. His history of euphonium “firsts” is impressive: first euphonium recital in New York’s Carnegie Recital Hall, 1976; first euphoniumist to serve as president of the International Tuba Euphonium Association (ITEA), formerly Tubist’s Universal Brotherhood Association (TUBA); first euphonium concert tour of Japan; first Guest Euphonium Artist-Falcone International Euphonium Competition; first euphonium master class at the Paris Conservatory Superior of Music, France; Master teacher at the first Deutsche Tubaforum workshop to include the euphonium, tenor horn and baritone, Hammelburg, Germany, 1991.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>Dr. Brian L. Bowman enjoyed a distinguished career as a soloist and recording artist, and remains in great demand as a clinician and educator throughout the world. Dr. Bowman has held the principal euphonium position, in addition to being a featured soloist, in each of the bands he has been associated with: The University of Michigan Symphony Band, the United States Navy Band, The United States Bicentennial Band, The United States Air Force Band and the River City Brass Band in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</div><br><div>He has performed as a soloist in all 50 states, Canada, Mexico, The Virgin Islands, Norway, Finland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Hungary, Great Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, Tonga Taiwan, Thailand and the People’s Republic of China. He has appeared as tenor tubist with the New York Philharmonic, the National Symphony, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Colorado Symphony, the San Francisco Symphony, Oklahoma City Philharmonic, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Fort Worth Symphony, and the Orchestra Symphonica of Xlapa, Mexico. He has performed concertos with the Lexington Kentucky Symphony, the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, the North Carolina Symphony and the Madison Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra.
</div><div>In addition to his live performances, Dr. Bowman can be heard on over 35 service band recordings and his six solo albums. He has appeared as featured soloist on Iowa Public Television with the Karl King Fort Dodge Municipal band and performed with the New Sousa Band in the Wolftrap PBS television special.</div><br><div> Perhaps it is his dedication to outstanding musical performance that makes him such an inspiring clinician and educator. He is the author of Practical Hints for Playing the Euphonium / Baritone Horn and he frequently publishes articles in professional journals. His work as a clinician and soloist at such conferences as the Mid-West International Band &amp; Orchestra Clinic, The British Association of Symphonic Bands &amp; Wind Ensembles and many national and international brass symposia have won him international recognition. In 1989 he was awarded the British Bandsman Magazine’s “Euphonium Player of the Year”, and in 1995 was given the Lifetime Achievement Award from the TUBA.
</div><div>As an authority in the field of euphonium performance, Brian Bowman has been asked to serve as adjudicator of many national and international euphonium competitions over the past thirty years. He has been a member of competition juries for international professional music competitions in the United States, France and Japan. Brian Bowman has also contributed significantly to the field of euphonium instrument design and was instrumental in the development and success of the Willson euphonium, produced by the Willson Musical Instrument Company in Flums, Switzerland and distributed by Getzen. He has also been a frequent consultant for other musical instrument companies and designed a special line of Brian Bowman euphonium mouthpieces.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Dr. Bowman has contributed significantly to the body of literature available for euphonium performers today; a major thrust of his career has been working to generate quality new compositions for his beloved instrument. Many of Dr. Bowman’s accomplishments and contributions have been documented in a doctoral dissertation, “The Life and Career Contributions of Brian L. Bowman through 1991," written by Sharon Elise Huff at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1994.
</div><div>In 2010 Dr. Bowman received the Clifford Bevan Award for Meritorious work in Low Brass Scholarship, at the International Tuba Euphonium Conference. In 2016 The American Bandmaster Association bestowed upon him the Edwin Franko Goldman Memorial Citation given for those who have rendered conspicuous service in the interest of Bands and Band Music in America.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Dr. Bowman retired as Regent’s Professor of Music (Euphonium) in the College of Music at The University of North Texas (UNT) in 2018 following 19 years service. Upon his retirement the Dr. Brian Bowman Euphonium Endowed Scholarship was established at UNT. Dr. Bowman believes that music is a most effective art form when used to communicate. To hear him or study with him is to know he is a powerful communicator and a master of that art form.&nbsp;</div><div>
